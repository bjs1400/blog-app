# blog-app
Blog Application using Meteor, React, React Router, and semantic-ui

This was my first time working with Meteor, so I apologize if there are errors. Hopefully they will be fixed soon.

This app allows users to login, signup, view blog posts if they are signed in, and access users if they are an admin

Functionality is provided for the following routes:

/login
/signup 
/blog 
/blog/:id 
/post/new 
/post/edit/:id 
/admin/user
